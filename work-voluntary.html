              Pareto.AI is an AI-driven company focused on developing
              intelligent learning solutions. From 2024 to 2025, I worked there
              as a Mathematics AI Trainer and AI Training Captioner. In these
              roles, I crafted mathematical questions with solutions and
              generated detailed captions to enhance AI-generated content. This
              experience strengthened my problem-solving skills, as I had to
              create a wide range of mathematical problems, my creativity in
              designing new and varied questions, and my written communication
              skills by ensuring my explanations and captions were clear,
              concise, and accurate for interpretation.

              The Access Project is a non-profit organisation that supports
              students from disadvantaged backgrounds to access top universities
              through tuition, coaching and in-school tutoring. Since 2021, I've
              been voluntarily working there as a tutor, tutoring GCSE and
              A-level mathematics and further mathematics. I am pleased with how
              my contribution has made a real impact to students, in particular,
              one of my students achieved a grade 9 in his GCSE mathematics exam
              which is the highest possible grade.

              When I was studying for my A-level qualifications at Maiden Erlegh
              School, I worked as an assistant at homework club, it was an
              after-school club where students would come to do any homework
              given by their teachers. My responsibilities included supervising
              and supporting students with homework. I also volunteered at the
              Maths drop-in sessions where students who found certain maths
              problems or concepts to be challenging can ask for help. My role
              involved guiding them through their difficulties and ensuring they
              gained a better understanding resolve their problems. I stopped
              working and volunteering at Maiden Erlegh School after I graduated
              in 2020.
